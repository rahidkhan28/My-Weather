How to Run the Application:

Clone the Repository: Go to the GitHub page of the React project you want to download. Find the green "Code" button and click on it. Then select "Download ZIP". Alternatively, you can copy the repository URL and use Git to clone it to your local machine by running:

git clone <repository_url>
Navigate to the Project Directory: Once the repository is downloaded, unzip it if you downloaded it as a ZIP file. Then, open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory of the project using the cd command. For example:

cd path/to/project
Install Dependencies: Most React projects come with dependencies that need to be installed before running the project. In the project directory, run:

This command will install all the dependencies listed in the package.json file.

Start the Development Server: After installing the dependencies, you can start the development server. Typically, React projects come with a script to do this. Run:

npm start
This command will start the development server and automatically open your default web browser to view the project. If it doesn't, you can access it by navigating to http://localhost:3000 in your web browser.

View the Project: Once the development server is running, you should see the React project running in your web browser. Any changes you make to the code will be automatically reflected in the browser without needing to refresh the page.

That's it! You've successfully downloaded a React GitHub project and ran it locally on your machine.

The project has been deployed to github pages can be directly opened - Link - https://rahidkhan28.github.io/My-Weather/

--IMPORTANT--
-The website is encountering a problem where it gets stuck on the loading screen after you enter the location and initiate the search. This happens because the number of API requests has exceeded the limit allowed. You'll need to wait for some time and try again later.
